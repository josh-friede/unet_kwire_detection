# unet_kwire_detection
A U-Net Framework for Detecting K-Wires in Fluoroscopic Images

## Abstract
This work details the application of deep learning techniques
to advance the image analysis of an orthopedic
surgery simulator project. The methods applied include a
prominent neural network architecture – U-Net – and the
recently-proposed concept of using synthetic images to train
a network for detecting objects in real-world images. While
there is additional future work needed, the preliminary results
are promising, and the implications exciting.
